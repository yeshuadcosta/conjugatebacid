## The Modern Iteration of Y2K

On 19 July, 2024, about 8.5 million computers around the globe running Microsoft Windows gave a very specific error message. Every single one of these machines contained higly sensitive information. This error affected Banks, Airline Companies and Government and Healthcare Departments.

The error was traced to a specialised Antivirus Program - Crowdstrike Falcon, which operates at the kernel level to prevent virus and malware attacks from spreading in a computer by terminating it before the attack even begins. A single bug in Crowdstrike Falcon caused the error at the kernel level component of Microsoft Windows.

An immediate fix from IT Admins was to login into these computers via 'Safe Mode,' and unroll the update from Crowdstrike. Later on, # Microsoft releases recovery tool to help repair Windows machines hit by CrowdStrike issue. A patch was later deployed to all Windows Computers, probably to fix the vulnerablilty and prevent the isssue from recurring.

This event was dubbed, 'The Modern Y2K, ' due to the panic and disruption that it caused on a global scale which replicated the expectations of the Y2K on New Year's Eve, 1999.
The very fact that modern civilisation depends so heavily upon computers that a single bug in an antivirus program has enough to disrupt its normal course. This raised public concern and also gave to many memes.

On the contrary, Macintosh and Linux systems remained unaffected by the bug.
