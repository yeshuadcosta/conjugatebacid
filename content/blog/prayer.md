### Poem On Prayer

**Prayer**, What a *beautiful* thing  
Raid the **devil**, *victory* you shall bring;  
*Abandon* your **wordly addictions**  
*Yearn* for **God**,  
He will *eradicate* your **afflictions**;  
*Raise* up your problems,  
***Prayer helps with that***  
**Faithfulness**, it *instills* in you,  
Certainly **not** the spirit of a *brat.*

~Yeshua D'Costa
